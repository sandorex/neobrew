# Neobrew - Intoxicating vim experience
Allows using [linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) inside your neovim

The plugin features
- Automated installation of homebrew without superuser priviledges (mainly targeted for sandboxed use as a flatpak)
- Automated installation/update of software from homebrew (like shellcheck for example)

## Installation
TODO

## Goal
This project is part of my goal of hardening neovim by running it with limited permissions in a flatpak
